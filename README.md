# pcb_defect_detection
This project focuses on detecting and classifying defects in printed circuit boards (PCBs) using computer vision and deep learning techniques. Leveraging a real-world dataset from Kaggle, it aims to build an end-to-end pipelineâ€”from data exploration to model training, evaluation, and deployment via a user-friendly app.
